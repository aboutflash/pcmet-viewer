A friendly frontend for pc_met service for private pilots.

## Synopsis
[**pc_met**](https://www.pcmet.de/fw/warn/sitemap.htm) is the official German service for aviators
to get detailed most actual weather information.

The user interface however rooted some time in the 1990s and still looks as charming as a crochet doily on a CRT television.

My goal was to change that a bit.
